Since Kibana will use port 80 to talk to Elasticsearch as opposed to the default port 9200, Kibana's config.js must be updated.

Open /usr/share/kibana-3.1.0/config.js and look for the following line:

elasticsearch: "http://"+window.location.hostname+":9200",
and replace it with the following line:

elasticsearch: "http://"+window.location.hostname+":80",
